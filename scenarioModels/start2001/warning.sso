This file contains warnings, suggestions and notes generated as files are read and processed

1 NOTE:  Max data length bin: 28  < max pop len bins: 30; so will accumulate larger pop len bins
2 1981benchmark year < styr; change to styr
3 settle_month is less than spawn_month, so logical age at settlement calculated to be: 1  for settle_time 1.  Does not match read value of 0 are you sure? 
4 setting in starter does not request all priors, and 1 parameters have priors and are not estimated, so their prior not included in obj_fun.
5 1st iteration warning: ssb(endyr)/ssb(styr)= 1.41972e-06; suggest start with larger R0 to get near 0.4; or use depletion fleet option
6 1st iteration warning: catch logL > 50% total logL; check configuration; suggest start with larger R0
7 setting positive forecast relF for forecast only fleet: 1
8 setting positive forecast relF for forecast only fleet: 2
9 Fmsy is <1/3 of Fspr are you sure?  check for convergence 
10 Final gradient: 2.69924e-05 is larger than final_conv: 1e-05
11 setting positive forecast relF for forecast only fleet: 1
12 setting positive forecast relF for forecast only fleet: 2
N warnings: 12
