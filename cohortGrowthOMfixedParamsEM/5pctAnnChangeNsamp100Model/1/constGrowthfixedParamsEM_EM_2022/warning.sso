settle_month is less than spawn_month, so logical age at settlement calculated to be: 1  for settle_time 1.  Does not match read value of 0 are you sure? 
setting in starter does not request all priors, and 1 parameters have priors and are not estimated, so their prior not included in obj_fun.
Final gradient: 0.785009 is larger than final_conv: 1e-05
