This file contains warnings, suggestions and notes generated as files are read and processed

1 NOTE:  Max data length bin: 28  < max pop len bins: 30; so will accumulate larger pop len bins
2 Forecast=0 or -1, so rest of forecast file will not be read and can be omitted;
2 A one year forecast using recent F will be done automatically
3 settle_month is less than spawn_month, so logical age at settlement calculated to be: 1  for settle_time 1.  Does not match read value of 0 are you sure? 
4 parameter init value is less than parameter min -0.311 < 0 for parm: 4 ; search for <now check> in echoinput for parm_type, will exit if prior requested
5 setting in starter does not request all priors, and 1 parameters have priors and are not estimated, so their prior not included in obj_fun.
